# My-first-projects
These are things i made while learning how to program, you can expect a lot of weird coding and not optimized things, but i've made sure they still work, maybe someday i'll try to optimize them.

They're all made on javascript on netbeans while i was learning, this taught me a lot of things alongside learning c++ in a way.

Keep in mind that since i'm spanish, these codes may have comments on spanish, but when i get the time, i'll try to explain them on english so everyone can understand what i made. 

Its gonna take a while to upload them all and translate them to english, and alzo organize them so please, have patience.

Since i'm still finishing my career, I wanna make clear that i made these things out of fun, and I hope to get a project to work on soon, or get a job, or start developing games, its still a long way to go, but i'm proud of what i've made at the moment,
for now my priority its to learn how to optimize my code alongside learning new things.

Lastly, i'll add comments to these later on, for now, they're gonna be uploaded with the last modifications i made to them
