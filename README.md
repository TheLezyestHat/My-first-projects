# My-first-projects
These are things i made while learning how to program, you can expect a lot of weird coding and not optimized things, but i've made sure they still work, maybe someday i'll try to optimize them.

They're all made on javascript on netbeans while i was learning, this taught me a lot of things alongside learning c++ in a way.

Keep in mind that since i'm spanish, these codes may have comments on spanish, but when i get the time, i'll try to explain them on english so everyone can understand what i made. 

Its gonna take a while to upload them all and translate them to english, and alzo organize them so please, have patience
