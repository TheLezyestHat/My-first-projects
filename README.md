# My-first-projects
These are things i made while learning how to program, you can expect a lot of weird coding and not optimized things, but i've made sure they still work, maybe someday i'll try to optimize them.

They're all made on javascript on netbeans while i was learning, this taught me a lot of things alongside learning c++ in a way.
